Hi, myself Saurav Pokharel. I am international student from country of himalayas, Nepal. This is my second semester at Weber State University. I am majoring in computer science.
	To be very honest I am taking SOC 1010 instead of other is just to fullfill my general education requirement. I choose Dr. Reynolds for my SOC 1010 by researching about the professor and looking at good reviews ratings at ratemyprofessor.com.
